# What am I doing?
Using Chat GPT, I have decided to create a comprehensive plan to fully learn full stack development using Django and Vue.

This is the plan it suggested for me:

# Python - Automate the Boring Stuff

```python
Chat-GPT Reason:
This book has been chosen for its practical approach to teaching Python. It covers the fundamentals of Python through hands-on projects that automate tasks. This approach not only keeps the learning experience interesting but also directly showcases the power and versatility of Python.
```

This is a book that I have been wanting to go through, and now I have the opportunity to do so. Over the next few weeks or days, until I complete the book, I will dedicate my time to going through its contents and finishing it.

# Python - Django for Beginners/Professionals/APIs by William S. Vincent
I have selected these books as my resources to learn Django.

# Vue.js - Udemy/Vue Docs
Chat GPT recommended Vue Mastery, but I have decided to use the Udemy course that I already have and the Vue Docs.

# SQL - Mode's SQL School
```python

Chat-GPT Reason:
This platform provides an interactive learning experience for SQL, which is crucial in understanding database interactions. It allows you to write and execute SQL queries, providing immediate feedback and aiding in your understanding.
```
I am already familiar with SQL, but this will be a great resource for me to check out and learn from.

# Web Security: The Open Web Application Security Project
```python
Chat-GPT Reason:
OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization focused on improving software security. Their resources are written and vetted by industry professionals and are widely respected in the field. Their documentation covers the most common security threats and how to mitigate them.
```
I am excited about this section. Security has been a main concern of mine as I want to use this journey to be able to build my SaaS application.

# Testing: Django Documentation and Vue Testing Handbook
```python
Chat-GPT Reason:
Both resources are chosen for their comprehensive and specific coverage of testing in Django and Vue.js, respectively. Understanding how to write tests for your code is crucial for maintaining a robust application.
```
Testing will be covered through the Vue Udemy course and Django books, so I'm not too worried about this section.

# Deployment: Cloudflare Documentation
```python
This is the official documentation from Cloudflare. It covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, ensuring you understand the process of deploying your application on their platform.
```
Cloudflare will be my choice for deployment; however, I will be open to using different platforms.

# Storage: "The How-To' Guides for Amazon S3" on Udemy and AWS Official Documentation
```python
The Udemy course provides structured and interactive learning, perfect for getting started with AWS S3. It covers the essentials and provides hands-on practice. The official AWS S3 documentation is a comprehensive resource that you can refer to throughout your project development.
```

I'm not entirely sure about this, as my project will primarily involve uploading and downloading. I don't think it's necessary to go through a full course, but I will check it out and see if it's worth it.

# Ending
This is the roadmap Chat GPT provided for me to build secure SaaS applications using Python and Vue.

One thing I would like to add to this journey is Docker.


p.s this was corrected by chat-gpt, im lazy when it comes to writing/proof reading
